Part 1) Bug fix to login without any issues (20min)
There is no need to change or add login function. Interpret the code structure and set the correct environment by the experience of building projects.
Here is a login information.
✓ email: admin@gmail.com ✓ password: admin123

* Created .env files in both /Server and /Client

* Added to /Server/.env:
DB_URL=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017
DB=Prolink
NODE_ENV=development

* Added to /Client/.env:
REACT_APP_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5001/api

* Changed removed unneeded /api in /Client/.env
is now: REACT_APP_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5001

* Changed result inside of postApi within api.js to:
let result = await axios.post(constant.baseUrl + (path.startsWith('/') ? path : '/' + path), data, {
    headers: {
        Authorization: localStorage.getItem("token") || sessionStorage.getItem("token")
    }
})

* URL is now correct -> http://localhost:5001/api/user/login

- login issue is now fixed

Part 2) Implement Restful API of "Meeting" in the both of server and client sides (40min)
Focus Code Style and Code Optimization.
Reference other functions.

* Discovered /server/model/schema/meeting.js (MeetingHistory model) already exists.

* Discovered /server/controllers/meeting/meeting.js with skeleton function definitions already in place.

* Updated add function inside /server/controllers/meeting/meeting.js. Implemented logic to create and save a new meeting document to MongoDB using MeetingHistory.create()
