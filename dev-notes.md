## Part 1) Login Bug Fix

**Work Done:**
- Fixed incorrect `/Client/.env` that had `/api` suffix.
- Final value:
  ```
  REACT_APP_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5001
  ```
- Adjusted `postApi` function to properly prepend paths.
- Ensured login and token storage working fine.

User can now log in properly.

## Part 2) Implement "Meeting" CRUD 

**Backend Changes:**
- Created `/server/controllers/meeting/_routes.js` with proper REST routes.
- Implemented `add`, `index`, `view`, `deleteData`, and `deleteMany` in `/controllers/meeting/meeting.js`.
- Confirmed API endpoints:
  | API | Status |
  |:----|:-------|
  | `POST /api/meeting/add` |
  | `GET /api/meeting` |
  | `GET /api/meeting/view/:id` |
  | `DELETE /api/meeting/delete/:id` |
  | `POST /api/meeting/deleteMany` |

**Frontend Changes:**
- Built out Meetings table inside `/views/admin/meeting/index.js`.
- Implemented add, delete (single + multiple).
- Polished `AddMeeting` modal to refresh table immediately on Save.
- Fixed `deleteManyApi` and `postApi` to properly handle paths.

Full Meeting CRUD flow working.

## Part 3) Bonus Improvements 

- Cleaned up `/views/admin/meeting/Addmeeting.js`:
  - Removed unused states: `leadData`, `contactData`, etc.
  - Removed unused imports like `getApi`, `useSelector`.
- Cleaned up `/views/admin/meeting/index.js`:
  - Removed old commented code.
  - Added `MeetingView` modal to properly View a meeting.
  - Managed modal opening/closing through `viewOpen` and `selectedMeetingId`.

Codebase now much cleaner and minimal.

## Part 4) Meeting View Fix 

**Problem:**
- Clicking a meeting did not show details. Empty modal.
- Console showed error: `TypeError: Failed to construct URL`.

**Root Cause:**
- The `getApi` call inside `meetingView.js` was missing `/api/` prefix.
- It was making the request to `/meeting/view/:id` instead of `/api/meeting/view/:id`.

**Fix Applied:**
- In `MeetingView.js`, updated:
  ```javascript
  await getApi('/api/meeting/view/', info?.event ? info?.event?.id : info);
  ```
- Confirmed meeting details now properly fetched and rendered.

View Meeting Modal now fully working
